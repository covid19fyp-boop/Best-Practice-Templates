# Triage And Root Cause

## 1) Severity Model

- Define `sev1` to `sev4` with explicit customer and business impact.
- Define response-time expectations for each level.
- Define escalation path and decision owners.

## 2) Triage Steps

- Confirm incident scope and blast radius.
- Identify first failing layer and dependency chain.
- Distinguish trigger event from root cause.

## 3) Root Cause Discipline

- Use evidence from traces, logs, metrics, and recent changes.
- Avoid speculative fixes without reproducible support.
- Record uncertainty and follow-up checks explicitly.
