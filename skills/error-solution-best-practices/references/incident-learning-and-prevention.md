# Incident Learning And Prevention

## 1) Postmortem Quality

- Keep postmortems blameless and evidence-driven.
- Capture timeline, trigger, contributing factors, and missed safeguards.
- Include concrete prevention tasks with owners and deadlines.

## 2) Preventive Controls

- Add missing tests at the failed boundary.
- Add alerting for early indicators of recurrence.
- Update runbooks and escalation trees.

## 3) Trend Review

- Review recurring incident classes monthly.
- Prioritize systemic fixes over isolated patchwork.
