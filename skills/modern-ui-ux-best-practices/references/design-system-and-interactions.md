# Design System And Interactions

## 1) Design Token Discipline

- Define and reuse tokens for spacing, color, typography, radius, and elevation.
- Keep token naming stable and meaningful.
- Avoid hardcoded one-off values unless explicitly approved.

## 2) Component States

- Define default, hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, and error states.
- Keep behavior consistent across components and pages.
- Include empty and no-data patterns in design system scope.

## 3) Interaction Principles

- Keep primary actions obvious.
- Keep destructive actions guarded by clear confirmation.
- Keep feedback immediate after user actions.
