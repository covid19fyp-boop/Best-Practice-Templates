# Accessibility And Inclusive Design

## 1) Baseline Requirements

- Follow WCAG 2.2 AA as minimum target.
- Use semantic HTML and clear heading hierarchy.
- Ensure keyboard-only navigation for all interactive controls.

## 2) Visual Accessibility

- Maintain accessible color contrast for text and controls.
- Keep visible focus indicators and do not remove outline without replacement.
- Respect reduced-motion preferences.

## 3) Forms And Errors

- Associate labels and helper text with fields programmatically.
- Present errors near fields and as summary where needed.
- Keep error language actionable and specific.
