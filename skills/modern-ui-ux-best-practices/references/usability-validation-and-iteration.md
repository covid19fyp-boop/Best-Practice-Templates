# Usability Validation And Iteration

## 1) Validate Before Broad Rollout

- Run scenario-based walkthroughs for primary journeys.
- Test with representative users where possible.
- Record confusion points and unresolved questions.

## 2) Capture Signals

- Track repeated user errors and abandonment hotspots.
- Monitor support requests tied to interface confusion.
- Keep usability findings linked to journey IDs.

## 3) Iterate With Ownership

- Convert findings into backlog items with owners and due dates.
- Re-test fixed journeys after release.
- Close only when measurable outcomes improve.
