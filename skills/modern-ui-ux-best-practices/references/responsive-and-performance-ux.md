# Responsive And Performance UX

## 1) Responsive Baseline

- Design mobile-first layouts and scale up progressively.
- Keep tap targets and spacing usable on touch devices.
- Test common breakpoints with real content, not placeholder-only content.

## 2) Performance Experience

- Monitor Core Web Vitals on key pages.
- Reduce layout shift through reserved dimensions and stable loading patterns.
- Keep interaction latency low for input-heavy screens.

## 3) State Design

- Use skeletons when content structure is predictable.
- Avoid spinner-only screens for long operations.
- Provide clear empty and retry states.
