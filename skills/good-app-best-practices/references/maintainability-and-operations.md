# Maintainability And Operations

## 1) Codebase Health

- Keep module boundaries and ownership clear.
- Keep interfaces and contracts explicit and version-aware.
- Reduce unnecessary complexity and dead code continuously.

## 2) Operational Readiness

- Keep dashboards aligned to critical user and system signals.
- Keep on-call runbooks executable and up to date.
- Keep dependency maintenance and migration backlog current.

## 3) Team Sustainability

- Make quality debt visible in planning, not hidden in side notes.
- Balance delivery speed with long-term maintainability targets.
