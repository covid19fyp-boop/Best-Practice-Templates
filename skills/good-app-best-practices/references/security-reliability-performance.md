# Security Reliability Performance

## 1) Security Baseline

- Enforce least privilege for application and infrastructure access.
- Keep dependency and image vulnerability scanning in CI.
- Keep auth controls and secret management reviewed regularly.

## 2) Reliability Baseline

- Define SLOs for critical user journeys.
- Monitor error budget burn and trigger policy actions when exceeded.
- Keep incident response playbooks current.

## 3) Performance Baseline

- Define latency and throughput targets per critical path.
- Track frontend and backend performance budgets.
- Prevent regressions with automated checks and staged rollout monitoring.
