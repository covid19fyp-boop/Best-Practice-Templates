# Intake And Scope

## Decision Framing

- State the exact engineering decision in one sentence.
- Define in-scope systems, repositories, and runtime environments.
- Define out-of-scope areas to prevent drift.

## Constraints

- Capture hard constraints: compatibility, compliance, uptime, budget, and staffing.
- Capture timeline constraints and release windows.
- Capture operational constraints: migration windows and rollback requirements.

## Success Criteria

- Define measurable outcomes for acceptance.
- Define explicit failure thresholds.
- Define what evidence is required to recommend adoption.
