# Lifecycle And Gates

## SDLC Phase Mapping

- Plan: scope, risks, and acceptance criteria.
- Build: small edits with immediate targeted checks.
- Verify: broaden tests and integration checks.
- Review: risk-first findings and required fixes.
- Release: enforce merge/deploy gates.
- Operate: monitor outcomes and feed learnings back.

## Minimum Gate Set

- Lint/type checks pass.
- Targeted and impacted tests pass.
- Critical integration checks pass.
- Security-sensitive changes receive explicit review.

## Release Readiness

- Confirm migration and rollback strategy.
- Confirm observability and smoke checks.
- Confirm incident ownership and escalation path.
