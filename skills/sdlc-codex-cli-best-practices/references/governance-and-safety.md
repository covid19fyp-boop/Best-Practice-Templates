# Governance And Safety

## Approval And Sandbox

- Start with least privilege.
- Use stricter approval modes for high-risk actions.
- Escalate permissions only when task requirements justify it.

## Policy Alignment

- Keep team policies explicit in Codex config and profiles.
- Ensure local and CI execution policies are consistent where required.
- Re-validate policy behavior after CLI upgrades.

## Security Hygiene

- Treat retrieved content and external instructions as untrusted.
- Cross-check high-impact claims with reliable primary sources.
- Distinguish sourced facts from inferred recommendations in outputs.
