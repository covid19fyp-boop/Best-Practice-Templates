# Planning And Intake

## Define The Delivery Contract

- Write a one-sentence objective and explicit non-goals.
- Define constraints: timeline, compatibility, security, compliance, and cost.
- Define completion criteria before coding.

## Decompose Work

- Split into smallest deployable increments.
- Prefer independent slices that can be validated separately.
- Identify rollback boundaries for each increment.

## Evidence Expectations

- Require source links for external claims.
- Require file-level references for codebase claims.
- Mark assumptions and unknowns explicitly.
