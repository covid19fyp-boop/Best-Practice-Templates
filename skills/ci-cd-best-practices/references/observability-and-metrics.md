# Observability And Metrics

## Pipeline Observability

- Track pipeline duration, queue time, and failure hotspots.
- Track flaky-test rate and recurring gate failures.
- Track deployment success by environment and service.

## Delivery Metrics

- Track lead time for changes.
- Track deployment frequency.
- Track change failure rate.
- Track mean time to restore service.

## Continuous Improvement Loop

- Review failed releases and incidents in regular cadence.
- Convert recurring failure patterns into new automated gates.
- Revisit gate strictness based on measured outcomes.
