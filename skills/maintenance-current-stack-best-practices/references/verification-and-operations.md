# Verification And Operations

## 1) Post-Change Verification

- Run regression suite and domain-critical smoke checks.
- Validate background jobs, cron tasks, and async processing health.
- Confirm dashboards and alerts are still meaningful after changes.

## 2) Incident Readiness

- Update runbooks for new failure modes introduced by upgrades.
- Ensure on-call knows rollback triggers and command sequence.
- Capture lessons learned into next maintenance cycle.

## 3) Governance

- Track maintenance debt in backlog with owners and deadlines.
- Keep monthly review for drift, vulnerabilities, and deferred upgrades.
