# Prompting And Scoping

## Define The Research Contract

- State the decision to be made, not just the topic.
- State constraints explicitly (time, cost, risk, stack, compliance).
- State what "done" looks like (for example: ranked options with evidence).

## Prompting Patterns For Research

- Ask for a plan first when the domain is broad.
- Ask Codex to separate facts, assumptions, and inferences.
- Ask for confidence labels and why confidence is low where applicable.
- Ask for explicit unknowns instead of implied certainty.

## Checkpointing

- Split large research into phases: discovery, validation, synthesis.
- Require a short checkpoint summary before moving to next phase.
- Refine scope after each checkpoint to avoid context drift.

## Output Discipline

- Require direct source links for factual claims.
- Require concrete dates for time-sensitive information.
- Require a recommendation plus alternatives and tradeoffs.
