# Source Selection And Web Research

## Source Priority

- Priority 1: official product documentation and standards.
- Priority 2: primary maintainer publications and release notes.
- Priority 3: secondary commentary only for context, never as sole proof.

## Cached Versus Live Web Search

- Use cached search for lower-risk browsing and stable retrieval.
- Use live search when information freshness is a hard requirement.
- Prefer domain filtering when you need high-trust sources quickly.

## Freshness Rules

- For changing topics, verify "last updated" and publication dates.
- Do not reuse old claims without re-checking current documentation.
- Record the verification date in the final output.

## Evidence Capture

- Keep one source URL per material claim.
- Capture source title and publication/update date where available.
- If sources conflict, report the conflict and explain resolution.
